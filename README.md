# NeutrophilSwarming

File to explain how to use the MATLAB(R) software for neutrophil swarming analysis.

Each parameter is calculated using a different script. For example, the script calc_speed_time calculates the speed vs time.

Each script runs the data from all experiments for each condition at once. The first input variable needed is the number of experiments. This number is associated with the number of Microsoft(R) Excel files (generated by Imaris(R) software in our case). If a different format of Microsoft(R) Excel file is given, then the user should modify the functions 'read_xls_file.m' and 'read_xls_file_area.m'.

Each script reads a data function (e.g. data_tracking.m) which includes the properties of the experiments of each condition, e.g. a) the name of the excel files, b) the pixel size, c) the time post-wounding that imaging started, d) the wound perimeter. These data functions should be in the same folder as the scripts.

To run a script, click 'Run', assuming Microsoft(R) Excel files and data functions have been generated. To run a different condition, the user should change the number of experiments, the data function name, the source data folder and the output file name. In all scripts, these are denoted with a (*).

For each script, an example data function is provided. Additionally, an example of source data is provided for calculation of kinetics and cluster size.
